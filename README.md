# VirtualBabyGame
This is my first-year Computer Engineering project: a simple yet fun virtual baby game! You can name your baby, feed, play, and put them to sleep. Each action affects hunger, sleep, and happiness stats. The game dynamically updates these stats based on user actions. Keep your baby happy and healthy!
